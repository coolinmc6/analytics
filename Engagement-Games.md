## Chapter 1: The Three Games of Engagement

- **Onboarding:** A series of steps within your product designed to show new users how they can use the product to obtain value.
- The Three Engagement Games
	+ Attention Game - maximize attention spent in-product or on-site
	+ Transaction Game - get customers to buy products
	+ Productivity Game - allows businesses to complete a task or improve workflow for user; typically B2B
	+ Amplitude has found that even if businesses say that they are in all three games, it's best to focus on one. Making a clear choice on which one to focus on is a big part of what strategy is.
- Why it's important to define a north star
	+ It gives your organization clarity and alignment on what the product team is optimizing for **and what can be traded off**
	+ Communicates the product organization's impact and progress to the rest of the company
	+ Holds product teams accountable to an outcome
	+ **KPI**: ‘Key Performance Indicator,’ a measurable value that demonstrates how well an organization is achieving its current objective.

> A north star metric is the key measure of success for the product team in a company. It defines the relationship between the customer problems that the product team is trying to solve and the revenue that the business aims to generate by doing so.

- What is the customer value exchange for your game
	+ The *value exchange* between business and customer is as follows. A business makes a product that offers some value to customers - entertainment, efficiency, status, etc. - and the customer in return offers some form of compensation to the business.
	+ To increase engagement, it is important that you understand the various actions within your product that provide value (realized value, in particular) to your customer
	+ Metrics for the *Attention Game*
		* time spent within the product
		* number of sessions over a period of time
		* how many times users performed a critical event over a period of time
	+ Metrics for the *Transaction Game*
		* Browsing doesn't add value - you need to get users to add things to a card, enter their credit card number, and complete their transaction
	+ Metrics for the *Productivity Game*
		* These kinds of products help customers increase efficiency
		* As a product person, you need to help customers **overcome the adoption barrier** by creating a desire for your product, making your interface easy to learn, and worth their investment in time and money.
- What is the Engagement Loop
	+ The engagement loops helps you and your team understand and describe the timeline of interactions from your customer's perspective

> In order to grow, every “engaging” product needs an interaction loop that maximizes the value created in your user’s first session and brings them back regularly

- Maximize value in the first session! Once you get someone to sign-up, how do you get them to your product's Aha Moment? These are some good questions:
	+ What am I doing to drive a curious customer to their a-ha moment?
	+ What is my recurring unit of value exchange?
	+ What is the customer investing in that I can leverage to make each subsequent exchange of value more valuable?
	+ How am I timing my ask for reviews and referrals from customers?
- Look at Spotify's onboarding - it's a great example of a simple flow and gets them to enjoying Spotify and **seeing value** as soon as possible:

- Notice how Slack updated their onboarding copy to make their value prop simpler:

- Here are the above tips simplified:
	+ Lesson #1: Remove any possible barrier to accessing your main value proposition
		* This means streamlining your UI to make the a-ha moment idiot proof.
		* Remove Distractions
		* Prevent Wandering / Exploration
		* Get it down to the minimum number of steps for users to realize that moment of magic
		* Example: Spotify Onboarding
	+ Lesson #2: Give the customer instant feedback on their actions to affrm the value exchange
		* Use subtle UX cues to affirm the value exchange so the customer can cleary follow what happened and take a moment to internalize it
		* Example: Slack "welcome" copy
	+ Lesson #3: Create benefits for customers to increase their investment in yor product
		* For Asana, this means "Gamification" where if they complete a task, the little "celebration creature" zooms across the screen
		* **Key:** Small, random indicators of success / achievement can boost how someone feels about using your product
	+ Lesson #4: Prompt for referrals and reviews after the customer has already started investing
