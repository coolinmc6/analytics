## Chapter 01: Why You Need to Care About User Retention

- acquiring users isn't the whole answer - keeping them is key!
- if you don't demonstrate value to your customers early and often, using your product won't become a habit and they won't return
- CM - how often should someone be using your product? How do we ramp them up in the product and get them using it?
- **Retention** is a measure of how many users return to your product over time.

> The point is, every improvement that you make to retention also improves all of these other things — virality, LTV, payback period. It is literally the foundation to all of growth, and that’s really why retention is the king.

- your goal should be increase user retention is minimize churn
- A key metric is **N-Day Retention** where Day 0 is the day they first use the product and then you see whether that user has returned on Day 1, Day 5, etc. It creates a retention curve as shown below:

![Retention Curve]()

- If Day 7 is retention is 13%, it means that out of all the users who first used the product on Day 0, came back and where active on Day 7
- Retention matters **IMMEDIATELY**, not later once you're past a certain "growth" period...if you don't retain users, you don't have product-market fit. See below

![Retention Curve Showing Product-Market Fit]()

- You need to build a product that people will get hooked on; you need a *habit-forming* product
- You need to understand what value your users get out of your product - figure out what your power users are doing a nudge your user base to behave more like them
- Diagnosing and improving retention is an iterative, ongoing process
- There are couple ways to improve retention:
	+ #1 - Shift the Retention Curve up
		* move Day 1 retention from 30% to 40%, Day 20 from 20% to 25%, etc.
	+ #2 - Flatten your Retention Curve
		* instead of it gradually sloping down with each passing day, have it flatten out which means upping your further out N-Day retention.
- Amplitude has its own Retention Framework which I'll be examining later

## Chapter 02: Your Critical Event & Product Usage Interval

- Amplitude recommends doing a few things before really digging into this chapter:
	+ make sure analytics is properly tracking the user actions important to you
	+ perform an instrumentation review
		* CM - this looks pretty valuable and would be a good way to get everyone on the team on the same page
	+ have a high-level understanding of users BEFORE you put the retention lifecycle framework in place
- A **critical event** is an action that users take within your product that aligns closely with your core value proposition.
	+ This is what you want your users to do! Think about it - what is the one thing you want your users to do
	+ in Airbnb's case it is book a room
- A good rule of thumb is one critical event per product offering
- in a marketplace, where you have two main types of users (i.e. buyers and sellers), you may have two critical events, one for each
- Determine your products usage interval - daily? weekly? monthly?
- If you don't have a good gauge of how often users should be using your product, you'll misinterpret your retention metric and misinform your strategies to improve it
- There is a Usage Interval Framework to better understand your usage interval
	+ **Key Point:** Identify the time interval at which *80%* of users have repeated the critical event
	+ pages 20 - 22 have a little worksheet to look at your analytics; take a look

## Chapter 03: The Retention Lifecycle Framework

- There are three main types of retention:
	+ N-Day Retention
	+ Unbounded Retention
	+ Bracket Retention
- N-Day Retention is **most popular**; usually, when people talk about retention, they refer to N-Day Retention
	+ this measure is best for gaming or social apps or any other type of product where you're trying to get users to exhibit regular, repeat behavior
- The day a user is **first active** in your app/service is Day 0. You have to define what that means; that could be:
	+ day of first download
	+ day of registration
	+ day they performed an action in your app
	+ day they played their first song
	+ day they added a friend
	+ etc.
