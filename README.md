## Notes

### AARM Method

- AARM Metrics or the AARM Method is a framework for understanding a product's metrics
- AARM is an acronym that refers to the four main categories: **A**cquisition, **A**ctivation, **R**etention, and **M**onetization.
- Acquisition
	+ tracking customer sign-ups
- Activation
	+ getting those acquired users to register fully (i.e. for Google+, upload a photo or complete their profile)
- Retention
	+ getting users to use the service
- Monetization
	+ collecting revenue from users
